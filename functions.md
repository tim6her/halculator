Currently the following functions are implemented:

## Operators

  * `+`
  * `-`
  * `*`
  * `/`
  * `^`

## Misc

  * `sum` (sum of all elements in stack)
  * `prod` (product of all elements in stack)
  * `!` (factorial)
  * `nCr` (n choose r)
  * `abs`
  * `..` (range between two values)

## Constants

  * `pi`
  * `e`

## Functions with Exponents

  * `exp`
  * `log` (logarithm with respect to Euler constant `e`)
  * `ln` (alias for `log`)
  * `sqrt`
  * `logBase` (Logarithm of `x` with respect to base `y`)

##  Trigonomitry and Hyperbolics

  * `sin`
  * `cos`
  * `tan`
  * `asin`
  * `acos`
  * `atan`
  * `sinh`
  * `cosh`
  * `tanh`
  * `asinh`
  * `acosh`
  * `atanh`

## Control

  * `swp` (swap the first two elements in stack)
  * `cpy` (copy first element)
  * `rot` (rotate stack one element to the left)
  * `rotl` (alias for `rot`)
  * `rotr` (rotate stack one element to the right)
  * `clr` (clear stack)
  * `del` (remove first element from stack)
